Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of this app was to create a tool for tracking the users weight. It requires the user to login and allow them to view their current weight, target weight, and a grid off all their logged weights, as well as allowing them to update theri information and logg new daily weights.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The first necessary screen was the login screen which allows the user to login or register a new account. The next screen was not striclty required but allows for greater ease of use, which is a home scree. the home screen allows the user to see their current progress as well as their targetr and current weight, it also allows the user to log their weight. The next screen is the grid view and this screen allows the user to see all of their logged wieghts in chornological order. It allows for the user to update or delete entries as well. The final screen is the settings screen> this is where the user cna enable notifications, change their password, set their target weight, or delete all of their logged weights

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The approach that is used was breaking the problem into smaller problems. I made a list of the functionality and then made a list for each function of what had to be done in order to make it work. This is defnietly a technique that i can apply to future projects as it is always easier to break things down then make a plan before starting.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

To test the codes funtionality i ran the code in the emulator and tried to use every feature i managed to implement, this definitly caught quite a few isuses and allowed me to go abck and fix them.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I am pretty happy with how my bottom navigation bar turned out, I think it is well coded and allows for easy acess to every screen that I have implemented.
